# SWORM [![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/sworm.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sworm) [![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/sworm.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sworm) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/featurist/sworm.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/featurist/sworm)

A very lightweight **write only** Node.js ORM, with support for:

* Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
* PostgreSQL
* MySQL
* Oracle DB
* Sqlite 3
* Browser Web SQL

## Changelog

See [changelog.md](changelog.md)

## NPM

    npm install sworm

Then install a database driver, one of:

    npm install mssql
    npm install pg
    npm install mysql
    npm install oracledb
    npm install sqlite3

There's no need to install a driver for Web SQL, sworm will pick it up from the `window` object.

See [sworm](https://www.npmjs.org/package/sworm) in NPM.

## Write Only?

The features in this module are mostly for **writing graphs of related entities**. Querying, on the other hand, is done with raw SQL so you can do it fast. See the [query API](#queries) for details.

This ORM avoids some of the largest issues experienced in other ORMs:

* query performance is too opaque
* N+1 queries are frequently the default
* configuring eager and lazy loading is tricky
* one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many relationships are notoriously difficult to get right
* lifecycle management of sessions and identity maps is rarely pleasant
* check out the massive generated SQL statements!

Just write SQL, you know how.

## Example

```js
var person = db.model({table: 'people'});
var address = db.model({table: 'addresses'});

var bob = person({
  name: 'bob',
  address: address({
    address: 'Fremantle'
  })
});

bob.save()
```

Produces:

    -------- people ----------
    | id | name | address_id |
    --------------------------
    | 11 | bob  | 22         |
    --------------------------

    ------- addresses ------
    | id | address         |
    ------------------------
    | 22 | Fremantle       |
    ------------------------

## Connection

Connect:

```js
db.connect(config? : {}, fn? : () -> Promise);
```

* `config` database connection configuration, see below
* `fn` if passed, `connect()` will connect to the database, run the function, then disconnect. Ensure that `fn` returns a promise.

You can pass connection configuration to the `sworm.db()` function, or to the `db.connect()` function.

```js
var sworm = require('sworm');

var db = sworm.db({
  driver: 'pg',
  config: {
    user: 'user',
    password: 'password',
    host: 'localhost',
    database: 'databasename'
  }
});

var person = db.model({table: 'people'});

var bob = person({name: 'Bob'});

// sworm connects at the first database interaction
bob.save();
```

Or define models then connect:

```js
var sworm = require('sworm');

var db = sworm.db();

var person = db.model({table: 'people'});

db.connect({
  driver: 'mssql',
  config: {
    user: 'user',
    password: 'password',
    server: 'localhost',
    database: 'databasename'
  }
}).then(function () {

  ...

});
```

Or connect, run some code and then disconnect:

```js
var sworm = require('sworm');

var db = sworm.db(config);

var person = db.model({table: 'people'});

db.connect(function () {

  // connected

  var bob = person({name: 'bob'});
  return bob.save().then(function () {
    ...
  });
}).then(function () {
  
  // disconnected

});
```

## Connection options:

```js
sworm.db(options)
sworm.db(url)
```

  * `url`, see urls for databases in respective section below

  * `options.driver`, one of `'mssql'`, `'mysql'`, `'pg'`, `'oracle'`, `'sqlite'` or `'websql'`.
  * `options.config` see configuration for databases in respective section below

  * `url` a connection URL, the following are supported
    * `pg` - `postgres://user:password@host:5432/database`. See the [`pg` url format](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg#connectstring-connectionstring-function-callback).
    * `oracle` - `oracle://user:password@host:1521/sid&maxRows=100000&pool=true`
  * `setupSession` a function that is passed the `db` to setup the session before any queries are run.

    ```js
    setupSession: function (db) {
      return db.query("alter session set time_zone = 'UTC'");
    }
    ```

  * `log`: either `true` to log SQL statements with `console.log()`

    Can also be a function for custom logging:

    ```js
    function (sql, params) {
      // sql == 'select * from people where name = @name'
      // params == {name: 'bob'}
    }
    ```

    Defaults to `false`, no logging.

### Driver Connection Config

* **mysql**

  See: [https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql#connection-options](https://github.com/felixge/node-mysql#connection-options)

  ```js
  {
    driver: 'mysql',
    config: {
      user: 'username',
      password: 'password',
      host: 'localhost',
      database: 'database name'
    }
  }
  ```

* **mssql**

  See: [https://github.com/patriksimek/node-mssql#configuration-1](https://github.com/patriksimek/node-mssql#configuration-1)

  ```js
  {
    driver: 'mssql',
    config: {
      user: 'username',
      password: 'password',
      server: 'localhost',
      database: 'databaseName'
    }
  }
  ```

* **postgres**

  URL: `postgres://user:password@host:5432/database`. See the [`pg` url format](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg#connectstring-connectionstring-function-callback).

  See: [https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg#connectstring-connectionstring-function-callback](https://github.com/brianc/node-postgres/wiki/pg#connectstring-connectionstring-function-callback)

  The driver will use connection pooling if you pass `pool: true`.

  ```js
  {
    driver: 'pg',
    config: {
      user: 'username',
      password: 'password',
      host: 'localhost',
      database: 'database name',
      pool: true
    }
  }
  ```

* **oracle**

  URL: `oracle://user:password@host:port/sid&maxRows=100000&pool=true`

  See: [getConnection()](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/doc/api.md#-332-getconnection)
  For `options` see [Oracledb Properties](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/doc/api.md#oracledbproperties)

  The driver fetches `maxRows` rows at a time, defaulting to 100. You may want to adjust this value if you expect large result sets, higher values can be faster but use more memory.

  The driver will use connection pooling if you pass `pool: true`.

  By default the driver is set to `autoCommit = true`, you can pass `options: { autoCommit: false}` to turn this off again.

  ```js
  {
    driver: 'oracle',
    config: {
      user: 'username',
      password: 'password',
      connectString: 'localhost/XE',
      pool: true,

      options: {
        // options to set on `oracledb`
        maxRows: 1000
      }
    }
  }
  ```

  The driver can also use an existing pool:

  ```js
  {
    driver: 'oracle',
    config: {
      pool: pool // from oracledb.createPool(config, cb),

      options: {
        // options to set on `oracledb`
        maxRows: 1000
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* **sqlite**

  URL: `file:///absolute/path/to/database.db` or `relative/path/to/database.db`

  See: [https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API#new-sqlite3databasefilename-mode-callback](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API#new-sqlite3databasefilename-mode-callback)

  ```js
  {
    driver: 'sqlite',
    config: {
      filename: 'filename or :memory:'
    }
  }
  ```

* **websql**

  URL: `websql:///db-name` or `db-name`

  ```js
  {
    driver: 'websql',
    config: {
      name: 'db-name',

      // the `openDatabase` function to connect to the DB, defaulting to `window.openDatabase`
      openDatabase: window.openDatabase,

      // dababase size, defaulting to 5M
      size: 5 * 1024 * 1024
    }
  }
  ```

### Close

Close the connection after use:

```js
db.close()
```

### Debug

This module uses [debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug), so you can easily see what's happening under the hood by setting a `DEBUG` environment variable.

```js
DEBUG=sworm node myapp.js
```

There are various schemes you can use:

* `sworm` all queries
* `sworm:results` all results
* `sworm:mssql` exact query passed to mssql
* `sworm:mysql` exact query passed to mysql
* `sworm:pg` exact query passed to postgres
* `sworm:oracle` exact query passed to oracle
* `sworm:sqlite` exact query passed to sqlite3
* `sworm:websql` exact query passed to websql

## Models

```js
var createEntity = db.model(options);
```

`createEntity` is a function that can be used to create entities from the model.

`options` can contain the following:

  * `table` (`undefined`) the name of the table to save entities to
  * `id` (`'id'`) the name of the identity column. This can be an array of id columns for compound keys, or `false` if there is no id column.
  * `foreignKeyFor` a function that returns a foreign key field name for a member (see [Relationships](#relationships)), defaults to:

    ```js
    function foreignKeyFor(fieldName) {
      return fieldName + '_id';
    }
    ```

  * for oracle `idType` (`oracledb.NUMBER`) is the type of the identity column, for e.g. `oracledb.STRING`.
  * for mssql `generatedId` (`scope_identity`) is the method to get the generated id for insert statements:

    * `scope_identity` uses `scope_identity()` to get the generated id, this is the default.
    * `output` uses `output inserted.id` to get the generated id. This will work for `uniqueidentifier` column types but is not compatible with tables that have triggers.

### Model Methods

Any other properties or functions on the `options` object are accessible by entities.

```js
var address = db.model({
  table: 'addresses',

  addPerson: function(person) {
    this.people = this.people || [];
    person.address = this;
    this.people.push(person);
  }
});

var fremantle = address({address: 'Fremantle'});
fremantle.addPerson(person({name: 'bob'}));
```

## Entities

The entity constructor takes an object with fields to be saved to the database.

```js
var person = db.model({...});

var bob = person({
  name: 'bob'
}, [options]);
```

Where options can have:
  * `saved`: if `true` will `update` the entity (if modified) on the next `save()`, if `false` will `insert` the entity on the next `save()`. Default `false`.
  * `modified`: if `true` (and if `saved` is true), will `update` the entity on the next `save()` regardless if it has been modified.

### Save

```js
var promise = entity.save([options]);
```

Inserts or updates the entity into the table. If the entity already has a value for its identity column, then it is updated, if not, it is inserted.

Objects know when they've been modified since their last insert or update, so they won't update unless a field is modified. You can force an update by passing `{force: true}`.

`save()` returns a promise.

### Identity

```js
entity.identity()
```

Returns the ID of the entity, based on the identity column specified in the model.

### Changed

```js
entity.changed()
```

Returns true if the object has been modified since the last `save()`.

## Relationships

Entities can contain fields that are other entities. This way you can build up graphs of entities and save them all in one go.

### Many to One

When entity A contains a field that is entity B, then B will be saved first and B's ID will be set and saved with A.

The foreign key of the member will be saved on the field name `member_id`. So `address` will have a foreign key of `address_id`. See the `foreignKeyFor` option in [Models](#models).

```js
var person = db.model({table: 'people'});
var address = db.model({table: 'addresses'});

var bob = person({
  name: 'bob',
  address: address({
    address: "15 Rue d'Essert"
  })
});

bob.save().then(function () {
  assert(bob.address_id == address.id);
});
```

Alternatively, you can specify the objects the other way around, the address on the outside (see [one-to-many](#one-to-many) for how this works):

```js
var essert = address({
  address: "15 Rue d'Essert",
  person: (address) => [
    person({
      name: 'bob',
      address: address
    })
  ]
})

essert.save()
```

In SQL:

    -------- people ----------
    | id | name | address_id |
    --------------------------
    | 11 | bob  | 22         |
    --------------------------

    ------- addresses ------
    | id | address         |
    ------------------------
    | 22 | 15 Rue d'Essert |
    ------------------------

### One to Many

When entity A contains a field that is an array that contains entities B and C. Then entity A will be saved first, followed by all entities B and C.

This allows entities B and C to refer to entity A, as they would in their tables.

```js
var person = db.model({ table: 'people' });
var address = db.model({ table: 'addresses' });

var bob = person({name: 'bob'});
var jane = person({name: 'jane'});

var essert = address({
  address: "15 Rue d'Essert",
  people: [bob, jane]
});

bob.address = essert;
jane.address = essert;

essert.save().then(function () {
  // all objects saved.
});
```

Alternatively, we can return the people in the address using a function. When the address is saved, the `people` function will be called with the owner address as the first argument, then we can set the foreign key for the people. Following the `save()` the results of the function will be saved as an array on the object.

```js
var person = db.model({ table: 'people' });
var address = db.model({ table: 'addresses' });

var essert = address({
  address: "15 Rue d'Essert",
  people: (addr) => [
    person({ name: 'bob', address: addr }),
    person({ name: 'jane', address: addr })
  ]
});

essert.save().then(function () {
  // all objects saved.
  // essert.people == [{name: 'bob', ...}, {name: 'jane', ...}]
});
```

Notice that whether we use an array or a function, the field itself is never saved to the database, only the entities inside the array.

In SQL:

    -------- people ----------
    | id | name | address_id |
    --------------------------
    | 11 | bob  | 22         |
    | 12 | jane | 22         |
    --------------------------

    ------- addresses ------
    | id | address         |
    ------------------------
    | 22 | 15 Rue d'Essert |
    ------------------------

### Many to Many

Many-to-many is just a combination of one-to-many and many-to-one:

```js
var db = sworm.db('test/test.db')
var person = db.model({ table: 'people' });
var personAddress = db.model({ table: 'people_addresses', id: ['address_id', 'person_id'] });
var address = db.model({ table: 'addresses' });

var bob = person({name: 'bob'});
var jane = person({name: 'jane'});

var fremantle = address({
  address: 'Fremantle',
  personAddresses: (address) => [
    personAddress({ person: bob, address: address }),
    personAddress({ person: jane, address: address })
  ]
});
var essert = address({
  address: "15 Rue d'Essert",
  personAddresses: (address) => [
    personAddress({ person: jane, address: address })
  ]
});

Promise.all([essert.save(), fremantle.save()]);
```

In SQL:

    -- people ---
    | id | name |
    -------------
    | 11 | bob  |
    | 12 | jane |
    -------------

    ------- addresses ------
    | id | address         |
    ------------------------
    | 22 | 15 Rue d'Essert |
    | 23 | Fremantle       |
    ------------------------

    ---- people_addresses ----
    | address_id | person_id |
    --------------------------
    | 22         | 12        |
    | 23         | 12        |
    | 23         | 11        |
    --------------------------

## Relationships Summary

In summary, a relationship can be a field containing one of the following:

* a sworm entity

  ```js
    outer({
      field: inner({ ... })
    })
  ```

  1. the entity is saved
  2. the ID is placed in the outer entity's `field_id` field. (See `foreignKeyFor`)
  3. the outer entity is saved
* an array of sworm entities

  ```js
    outer({
      field: [
        inner({ ... }),
        inner({ ... })
      ]
    })
  ```

  1. the outer entity is saved
  2. each of the entities in the array are saved
* a function that returns an array of sworm entities

  ```js
    outer({
      field: (outer) => [
        inner({ outer: outer, ... }),
        inner({ outer: outer, ... })
      ]
    })
  ```

  1. the outer entity is saved
  2. the function is called, passing the outer entity as the first argument
  3. the function returns an array of entities
  4. each of those entities are saved
  5. the array is assigned to the outer entity's field

# Unescaping

It's sometimes useful to pass in some real unescaped SQL, for this you can use `sworm.unescape()` for model values or query parameters.

Usual qualifiers apply here: when using this feature, make sure to protect your application from SQL injection by properly escaping strings with `sworm.escape()` or by being extra careful!

For example, you can pass in an array of values for an `in (...)` statement:

```js
db.query('select * from people where names in (@names)', {names: sworm.unescape("'bob', 'jane'")})
```

will become

```sql
select * from people where names in ('bob', 'jane')
```

These parameters are not passed to the database driver.

This is also useful for handling differences in database drivers, such as `sysdate` or `now`:

```js
db.query(
  'select * from people where subscription_date < @now',
  {now: sworm.unescape(usingSqlite? "date('now')": "now()")},
)
```

Or, to refer to SQL features when inserting, such as sequences in oracle:

```js
person({id: sworm.unescape('sequence.nextVal'), name: 'bob'}).save()
```

## Escaping

Use `sworm.escape(string)` to escape strings.

# Queries

```js
db.query(sql, [parameters]).then(function (records) {
});
```

Where:

  * `sql` is the SQL query, can be a query (i.e. select), or a command (update, insert, stored proc)
  * `parameters`. If `sql` contains parameters in the form of `@paramName` the corresponding property on the `parameters` object will be substituted into the SQL, doing any escaping necessary.

For select queries, returns an array of objects, containing the fields of each record.

```js
db.query('select * from people where name = @name', {name: 'Bob'}).then(function (results) {
  console.log(results);

  /*
     [
       {id: 2, name: 'Bob'}
     ]
   */
}); 
```

## Stored Procedure Example

```js
db.query('myProcName @param1, @param2', {param1: 'a', param2: 'b'});
```

## Model Queries

```js
model.query(sql, [parameters]).then(function (entities) {
});
```

Same as `db.query()` but records returned are turned into entities of the model that can subsequently be modified and saved.

```js
person.query('select * from people where id = @id', {id: 1}, function (people) {
  var bob = people[0];
  bob.name = 'Jack';
  return bob.save();
});
```

# Statements

Statements are just like queries but they don't bother to parse or log the results.

```js
db.statement(query, [params, [options]]);
```

# update, insert, upsert

You can explicitly `insert`, `update` or `upsert` a record:

```js
var bob = person({name: 'bob'})
bob.insert()
// insert into people (name) values ('bob')
```

```js
var bob = person({name: 'bob', id: 4})
bob.update()
// update people set name = 'bob' where id = 4
```

Upsert works by detecting the presence of an id, if there is an id, it updates the record, if not it inserts it.

```js
var bob = person({name: 'bob'})
bob.upsert()
// insert into people (name) values ('bob')
```

```js
var bob = person({name: 'bob', id: 4})
bob.upsert()
// update people set name = 'bob' where id = 4
```

For updates, an error is thrown if there are no records found with that id, or indeed if no id is given.

# Transactions

You can insert update or query the database using transactions. Transactions can be used in two forms, explicitly running `db.begin()`, `db.commit()` and `db.rollback()`, or by calling `db.transaction(fn)` with a function that will commit automatically if it didn't fail.

The explicit form:

```js
db.begin().then(() => {
  var bob = person({name: 'bob'});
  return bob.save();
}).then(() => {
  db.rollback();
  // or
  db.commit();
});
```

The implicit form:

```js
db.transaction(() => {
  var bob = person({name: 'bob'});
  return bob.save();
});
```

```js
db.begin([options]);
```

Begin the transaction

* `options` a string that is appended to the database's `begin` command, for e.g. `db.begin('isolation level read committed')` will result in the sql `begin isolation level read committed`.

```js
db.rollback();
```

Rollback the transaction

```js
db.commit();
```

Commit the transaction

```js
db.transaction(options? : String, fn : () => Promise)
```

* `options` a string that is appended to the database's `begin` command, for e.g. `db.begin('isolation level read committed')` will result in the sql `begin isolation level read committed`.
* `fn` a function that is executed after the transaction has begun. The function is expected to return a promise, if resolved, the transaction will be committed, if rejected, the transaction will be rolled back.

```js
db.transaction(() => {
  // this transaction will be rolled back
  return db.query('update people set name = @name', {name: 'jane'}).then(() => {
    throw new Error('uh oh!');
  });
});

db.transaction(() => {
  // this transaction will be committed
  return db.query('update people set name = @name', {name: 'jane'});
});
```

# Accessing the Connection

You can access the underlying driver's connection after the database has connected of course through `db.driver.connection`.

## Options

You can pass options to the database driver when executing a query

```js
db.query(sql, parameters, [options])
```

* SQLite3
  * `multiline` or `exec` runs the `exec()` method on the connection which executes multiple lines, see [exec](https://github.com/mapbox/node-sqlite3/wiki/API#databaseexecsql-callback). Note that this method ignores any query `parameters` passed in.
* Oracle
  * `formatRows` if `false` will not format rows as lower case and will return the raw `oracledb` results. Formatting rows may be a performance issue for large result sets.
  * any other options are passed to `oracledb`'s [`execute` method](https://github.com/oracle/node-oracledb/blob/master/doc/api.md#-4233-execute-options).

# Development

## Tests

The only thing slightly awkward about this project are the test environments for each database. I've tried to make this as easy as possible however:

* sqlite3 works out of the box on most if not all platforms
* mysql, postgres and oracle instances can be found in the `docker-compose.yml` file. Install docker, make it run somehow, then run `docker-compose up -d`. This will download and start each of the databases necessary to run the tests. The tests look for the `$DOCKER_HOST` environment variable to see where the docker host is, if it's in a VM or somewhere else, otherwise the databases are expected to be on localhost, running on their default ports.
* mssql is less friendly, and all I ask is that it's running on a machine called `windows` (hack your `/etc/hosts` file if necessary), with a fresh database called `sworm`, with user `user` and password `password`.

Each database can be tested individually by running `mocha test/{mssql,mysql,postgres,oracle,sqlite}Spec.js`. All of them with simply `npm test`.

Nevertheless, this project is almost entirely covered with tests and I expect any pull request to have tests that demonstrate any new feature or bugfix.
